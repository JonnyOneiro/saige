It is best to consult a professional practitioner as eczema is difficult to self-treat. However, the following remedies, taken for at least a week, can bring relief. Two remedies may be used at once. Chickweed reduces soreness or itchiness, and oats can be used to impart a soothing, emollient effect to bathwater. See also Skin Rashes.",
